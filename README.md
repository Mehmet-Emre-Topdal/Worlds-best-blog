# Worls's best blog web site !!! 
### This is a simple blog to practice: React Router v6.4, React Query, Tailwind and json-server

This is a practice project and a proof of that i know these libraries. Also there is a filter with search input. It is cute 

i did not much care about responsive since this is not the aim of project 

All the non-english (Turkish) things are notes/docs for me. Ä°gnore them 

#### To start application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

in another terminal
```bash
npm run db
```
